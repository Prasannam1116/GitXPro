– The Deque Interface


The Deque is the short name for “Double Ended Queue“. As the name suggest, Deque is a linear collection of objects which supports insertion and removal of elements from both the ends. The Deque interface defines the methods needed to insert, retrieve and remove the elements from both the ends.


 
The Deque interface is introduced in Java SE 6. It extends Queue interface. 

The main advantage of Deque is that you can use it as both Queue (FIFO) as well as Stack (LIFO). The Deque interface has all those methods required for FIFO and LIFO operations. Some of those methods throw an exception if operation is not possible and some methods return a special value (null or false) if operation fails.
the list of Deque Methods.

Operation	Throws an exception if operation fails.	Returns null or false if operation fails.
Insertion	
Front End	:addFirst()	offerFirst()
Rear End	addLast()	offerLast()
Retrieval	Front End	getFirst()	peekFirst()
Rear End	getLast()	peekLast()
Retrieval And Removal	Front End	removeFirst()	pollFirst()
Rear End	removeLast()	pollLast()


 Deque is nothing but the double ended queue. That means, you can insert, retrieve and remove the elements from both the ends. 


 


Deque As Queue :

As Deque interface extends Queue interface, it inherits all methods of Queue interface. So, you can use all those inherited methods to perform Queue operations. Along with them, methods defined in the Deque interface can also be used for Queue operations. Below is the list of Queue methods and their equivalent Deque methods.

Queue Methods	Equivalent Deque Methods
add()	addLast()
offer()	OfferLast()
element()	getFirst()
peek()	peekFirst()
remove()	removeFirst()
poll()	pollFirst()
Deque As Stack :

Deque interface has two more methods – pop() and push(). These two methods make Deque to function as a stack (Last-In-First-Out). Along with these two methods, you can also use addFirst(), peekFirst() and removeFirst() for stack operations. Below is the list of Stack methods and their equivalent methods of Deque.

Stack Methods	Equivalent Deque Methods
push()	addFirst()
pop()	removeFirst()
peek()	peekFirst()
Properties Of Deque :

Unlike Queue, Deque can have null elements. But, it is recommended not to insert null elements as many methods return null to indicate Deque is empty.
Deque can have duplicate elements.
You can’t set or get or insert the elements at an arbitrary position of Deque. i.e Random access is not possible with the Deque.
You can use removeFirstOccurrenec(E e), removeLastOccurrence(E e) and remove(E e) methods to delete the elements from the Deque.
